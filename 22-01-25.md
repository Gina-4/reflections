<h1>Reflection:</h1>

<p>Learnt a lot from Andrew a previous Take 2 graduate - his advice was helpful and he could easily relate to our new surrounding situation. Hearing about good job opportunities in the Tech Industry has given a sense of motivation. Got an introduction about HTML tags, currently testing them out now with my reflection. Nesting is interesting.</p>
