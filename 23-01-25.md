<h1>Reflection:</h1>
<br

<p>Today Josh gave a break down introduction about Git/Github. Richard proceeded with a group session on Te Whare Tapa Wha and setting individual goals. Co-hort 1 presented projects they have been working on, was great to see the amount of learning and knowledge they have gained from Take 2 so far.</p>
